; I personally use the Hasu USB to USB keyboard converter instead of this.
; https://www.1upkeyboards.com/shop/controllers/usb-to-usb-converter/

; IMPORTANT NOTE: (As of Jan 2019)
; Corsair's iCue CANNOT distinguish between different keyboards.
; That is, every Corsair keyboard you plug in will always behave the same as the others
; Meaning, you only get to use ONE Corsair keyboard at a time. You cannot have a Corsair macro
; keyboard AND a "normal" Corsair keyboard at the same time. For more info, watch this:

;;..............................................................................;;
;;............... BEGIN SECOND KEYBOARD iCue F24 ASSIGNMENTS ...................;;
;;..............................................................................;;

;; You should DEFINITELY not be trying to add a 2nd keyboard unless you're already
;; familiar with how AutoHotkey works. I recommend that you at least take this tutorial:
;; https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm

;; The point of these is that THE TOOLTIPS ARE MERELY PLACEHOLDERS. When you add a function of your own, you should delete or comment out the tooltip.

;; You should probably use something better than Notepad for your scripting. (Do NOT use Word.)
;; I use Notepad++. "Real" programmers recoil from it, but it's fine for my purposes.
;; https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
;; You'll probably want the syntax highlighting: https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=50

;;And THAT^^ is how you do multi-line instructions in AutoHotkey.
;;Notice that the very first line, "space::" cannot have anything else on it.
;;Also notice the mandatory RETURN at the very end.
;;Again, these are fundamentals that you should have learned from the tutorial.


;;===================== MODIFIERS =========================;;

;;Keep these commented out, as they are!
;Lshift::tooltip, do not use
;Lctrl::tooltip, do not use
;Lwin::tooltip, do not use
;Lalt::tooltip, do not use

;Ralt::tooltip, do not use
;Rwin::tooltip, do not use
;appskey::tooltip, This is not a modifier, but I replaced it with INTERNATIONAL4 (SC079) anyway, because it was able to misbehave.
;Rctrl::tooltip, do not use
;Rshift::tooltip, do not use


;;If you delete a modifier's key assignment in iCue, it'll act like a normal modifier.
;;that means you can use it in conjuction with the other keys, to achieve a different result, like so:
;+z::tooltip, you pressed SHIFT Z on the F24 keyboard.
;^z::tooltip, you pressed CTRL Z on the F24 keyboard.
;!z::tooltip, you pressed ALT Z on the F24 keyboard. I don't recommend this... ALT is dangerous because of menu acceleration, even if you try to disable it like I have
;^!z::tooltip, you pressed CTRL SHIFT Z on the F24 keyboard.
;;Etc.
;;However, I use few to no modifiers on my secondary keyboards... I prefer tap dance instead. The decision is up to you.
;;Note that any keys that do NOT have a modifier assignment, WILL behave normally. It's a trade off.
;;If none of that made sense, well look, you're just gonna have to experiment with it, ok?


;;================= MODIFIERS REMAPPED ======================;;

;; When you replace these with your own functions, I recommend that you do NOT delete the tooltips. Just comment them out. That way, you always know what was changed to what. It gets very confusing very quickly otherwise.
;; Here is the full list of scan code substitutions that I made:
;; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSj0gKDxyWAecB3SIyEZ2ssPETZkkxn67gdIwL1zFUs/edit#gid=824607963

;Numlock is an AWFUL key. I prefer to leave it permanently on.
;It's been changed to International 6, so you can use it with no fear that it'll mess up your numpad.

;Pause::msgbox, The Pause/Break key is a huge PITA. That's why I remapped it to SC07E
;Break::msgbox, Or is it THIS key? WHO KNOWS!

;;;--------------------IMPORTANT: HOW TO USE #IF THINGIES----------------------
;;;---------------(I don't know what they are actually called.)----------------

#if (getKeyState("F24", "P")) and if WinActive("ahk_exe Adobe Premiere Pro.exe")
F1::msgbox, You pressed F1 on your secondary keyboard while inside of Premiere Pro

;; HOWEVER, You still would still need to block F1 using #if (getKeyState("F24", "P"))
;; If you don't, it'll pass through normally, any time Premiere is NOT active.
;; Does that make sense? I sure hope so.

;; Alternatively, you can use the following: (Comment it in, and comment out other instances of F1::)
; #if (getKeyState("F24", "P"))
; F1::
; if WinActive("ahk_exe Adobe Premiere Pro.exe")
; {
	; msgbox, You pressed F1 on your secondary keyboard while inside of Premiere Pro
	; msgbox, And you did it by using if WinActive()
; }
; else
	; msgbox, You pressed F1 on your secondary keyboard while NOT inside of Premiere Pro
;;This is easier to understand, but it's not as clean of a solution.

;; #if (getKeyState("F24", "P")) && (uselayer = 0) ;;you can also use a varibable like so, but I don't.
